# SageMaker-to-Snowflake-Batch-Inference-Lab
In this lab, you’ll migrate an XGBoost model from SageMaker into Snowflake: log it in the Model Registry, perform batch inference via SQL, monitor performance and drift with ML Observability, and optionally retrain and promote a model version using Snowflake’s warehouse compute.
